Configurations
##########################################

PyPSA-Eur is able to provide the energy supply of an energy system  given :

* The configuration of the system by year-varying parameters (such as carbon budget, primary route share in steel production) and fixed parameters (such as maximum potential per renewable technologies, charging power of EVs)
* The technologies used, whose can be (de-)activated
* Techno-economic parameters (such as investment costs,efficiency,FOM,VOM, lifetime, discount rate, etc)

The quality of the optimization results depends on the database quality as :

* The evolution trajectory of year-dependent parameters has an impact on the energy demand for some parameters (by dispatching the total demand over different vectors) and fixed parameters have an impact on some technologies (through potential, minimum capacity factor, etc)
* The addition of a technology might lead to an energy system significantly cheaper throughout the optimization, due to otherwise non-existing or uninteresting interactions between technologies
* Some technologies might not be considered in the cost-optimal system because of too high CAPEX/OPEX, or might be massively installed because of too optimistic costs

Insights on how each of those topics are given in the following sections

Technological assumptions
===========================

PyPSA-Eur optimization of the energy system is done by computing the cost-optimal sizing of each technology per geographical location.

A technology can be used for

* Generation of energy using energy carrier(s) to produce other energy carrier(s)

  * i.e. using coal to produce electricity, atmospheric CO2 and captured CO2 for a coal powerplant with CC
  * i.e. using Hydrogen and captured CO2 to produce synthetic oil for the Fischer-Tropsh process
* Storage of energy under a specific energy vector

  * i.e. Centralized Thermal Energy Storage
  * i.e. Hydrogen underground storage
* Transmission of energy vector between two geographical locations

  * i.e. AC and DC lines
  * i.e. Methane pipelines
  * i.e. CO2 pipelines

List of technolgies used

The list of technologies used can be found in the PyPSA-configuration Excel under the tab Tech used

Techno-Economic parameters
===========================

The definition of the technologies in PyPSA is done by retrieving data from a cost database and formatting it into the metrics used by PyPSA-Eur, namely :

* Annualized Capital cost 	(â‚¬/MW/year)
* Marginal cost 	(EUR/MWh)
* Lifetime 	(years)
* Efficiency(ies)	(MWhout/MWhin)
* CO2 intensity   (tCO2/MWhout)
* Potential 	(MWhmax)
* Carrier(s)


The cost database has a granularity of up to 5 years and is mostly based on the Danish Energy Agency (DEA) forecasts (March 2018 - August 2023)

It must be noted nonetheless that for some technologies, some techno-economic parameters are set from the configuration file instead of the cost database

Configuration file
===========================

PyPSA-Eur optimization is mostly based on the choice of the technologie used and the techno-economic parameters from the cost database.

Some additional parameters can nonetheless be set from a separate configuration file. Those parameters can be grouped under different categories :

* On/off technology use : Levers (de)activating some technologies in PyPSA optimization

  * i.e. conventional technologies to consider in future planning horizons

* Technology parameters : techno-economic parameters that were not set from the cost database or that alter technologies

  * i.e. Potentials and correction factors for renewables
  * i.e.

* Demand-related parameters: share between different energy carriers of a given demand. They can be fixed over the explored time horizons or year-dependent

  * i.e. share of primary route in steel production
  * i.e. share of EV/ICE/FC vehicles for land transport
  * i.e. share of HVC routes compared to today's demand
  * i.e. year to consider for Eurostat reports

* Simulation parameters : parameters impacting the optimization constraints and definition

  * i.e. carbon budget per year
  * i.e. authorized expansion of AC/DC transmission lines
  * i.e. regionalized/copperplated ammonia at EU scale
  * i.e. Emission pricing per tCO2
  * i.e. locations where hydrogen storage is allowed

Those additional parameters default values can be modified to match expert's best estimate
