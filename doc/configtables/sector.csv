-- potential,,float,maximum fraction of urban demand which can be supplied by district heating increase of today's district heating demand to potential maximum district heating share
-- progress,,Dictionary with planning horizons as keys.,Progress = 0 means today's district heating share. Progress = 1 means maximum fraction of urban demand is supplied by district heating
-- district_heating_loss,,float,
