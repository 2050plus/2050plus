Release Notes
##########################################


Upcoming Release
================

* An option is introduced which adds constraints such that each country or node produces on average a minimal share of its total consumption itself.
  For example ``EQ0.5c`` set in the ``{opts}`` wildcard requires each country to produce on average at least 50% of its consumption. Additionally,
  the option ``ATK`` requires autarky at each node and removes all means of power transmission through lines and links. ``ATKc`` only removes
  cross-border transfer capacities. Moreover, line and link capacities can be capped in the ``config.yaml`` at
  ``lines: s_nom_max:`` and ``links: p_nom_max`` (`#166 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/166>`_).

* Added an option to alter the capital cost of carriers by a factor via ``carrier+factor`` in the ``{opts}`` wildcard. This can be useful for exploring uncertain cost parameters. Example: ``solar+0.5`` reduces the capital cost of solar to 50% of original values (`#167 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/167>`_).

* Add compatibility for pyomo 5.7.0 in :mod:`cluster_network` and :mod:`simplify_network`.

* Raise a warning if `tech_colors` in the config are not defined for all carriers.

* Corrected HVDC link connections (a) between Norway and Denmark and (b) mainland Italy, Corsica (FR) and Sardinia (IT) (`#181 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/181>`_)

* Added Google Cloud Platform tutorial (for Windows users).

* Corrected setting of exogenous emission price (in config -> cost -> emission price). This was not weighted by the efficiency and effective emission of the generators. Fixed in `#171 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/171>`_.

* Don't remove capital costs from lines and links, when imposing a line volume limit (wildcard ``lv``) or a line cost limit (``lc``). Previously, these were removed to move the expansion in direction of the limit.

* Fix bug of clustering offwind-{ac,dc} sites in the option of high-resolution sites for renewables. Now, there are more sites for offwind-{ac,dc} available than network nodes. Before, they were clustered to the resolution of the network. (e.g. elec_s1024_37m.nc: 37 network nodes, 1024 sites)

* Use `mamba` (https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) for faster Travis CI builds (`#196 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/196>`_)

* The N-1 security margin for transmission lines is now fixed to a provided value in ``config.yaml``, removing an undocumented linear interpolation between 0.5 and 0.7 in the range between 37 and 200 nodes.

* The mappings for clustered lines and buses produced by the ``simplify_network`` and ``cluster_network`` rules changed from Hierarchical Data Format (.h5) to Comma-Separated Values format (.csv) (`#198 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/198>`_)


PyPSA-Eur 0.2.0 (8th June 2020)
==================================

* The optimization is now performed using the ``pyomo=False`` setting in the :func:`pypsa.lopf.network_lopf`. This speeds up the solving process significantly and consumes much less memory. The inclusion of additional constraints were adjusted to the new implementation. They are all passed to the :func:`network_lopf` function via the ``extra_functionality`` argument. The rule ``trace_solve_network`` was integrated into the rule :mod:`solve_network` and can be activated via configuration with ``solving: options: track_iterations: true``. The charging and discharging capacities of batteries modelled as store-link combination are now coupled (`#116 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/116>`_).

* An updated extract of the `ENTSO-E Transmission System Map <https://www.entsoe.eu/data/map/>`_ (including Malta) was added to the repository using the `GridKit <https://github.com/PyPSA/GridKit>`_ tool. This tool has been updated to retrieve up-to-date map extracts using a single `script <https://github.com/PyPSA/GridKit/blob/master/entsoe/runall_in_docker.sh>`_. The update extract features 5322 buses, 6574 lines, 46 links. (`#118 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/118>`_).

* Added `FSFE REUSE <https://reuse.software>`_ compliant license information. Documentation now licensed under CC-BY-4.0 (`#160 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/160>`_).

* Added a 30 minute `video introduction <https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html>`_ and a 20 minute `video tutorial <https://pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html>`_

* Networks now store a color and a nicely formatted name for each carrier, accessible via ``n.carrier['color']`` and ``n.carrier['nice_name'] ``(networks after ``elec.nc``).

* Added an option to skip iterative solving usually performed to update the line impedances of expanded lines at ``solving: options: skip_iterations:``.

* ``snakemake`` rules for retrieving cutouts and the natura raster can now be disabled independently from their respective rules to build them; via ``config.*yaml`` (`#136 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/136>`_).

* Removed the ``id`` column for custom power plants in ``data/custom_powerplants.csv`` to avoid custom power plants with conflicting ids getting attached to the wrong bus (`#131 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/131>`_).

* Add option ``renewables: {carrier}: keep_all_available_areas:`` to use all availabe weather cells for renewable profile and potential generation. The default ignores weather cells where only less than 1 MW can be installed  (`#150 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/150>`_).

* Added a function ``_helpers.load_network()`` which loads a network with overridden components specified in ``snakemake.config['override_components']`` (`#128 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/128>`_).

* Bugfix in  :mod:`base_network` which now finds all closest links, not only the first entry (`#143 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/143>`_).

* Bugfix in :mod:`cluster_network` which now skips recalculation of link parameters if there are no links  (`#149 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/149>`_).

* Added information on pull requests to contribution guidelines (`#151 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/151>`_).

* Improved documentation on open-source solver setup and added usage warnings.

* Updated ``conda`` environment regarding ``pypsa``, ``pyproj``, ``gurobi``, ``lxml``. This release requires PyPSA v0.17.0.

PyPSA-Eur 0.1.0 (9th January 2020)
==================================

This is the first release of PyPSA-Eur, a model of the European power system at the transmission network level. Recent changes include:

* Documentation on installation, workflows and configuration settings is now available online at `pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io <pypsa-eur.readthedocs.io>`_ (`#65 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/65>`_).

* The ``conda`` environment files were updated and extended (`#81 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/81>`_).

* The power plant database was updated with extensive filtering options via ``pandas.query`` functionality (`#84 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/84>`_ and `#94 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/94>`_).

* Continuous integration testing with `Travis CI <https://travis-ci.org>`_ is now included for Linux, Mac and Windows (`#82 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/82>`_).

* Data dependencies were moved to `zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`_ and are now versioned (`#60 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/issues/60>`_).

* Data dependencies are now retrieved directly from within the snakemake workflow (`#86 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/86>`_).

* Emission prices can be added to marginal costs of generators through the keyworks ``Ep`` in the ``{opts}`` wildcard (`#100 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/100>`_).

* An option is introduced to add extendable nuclear power plants to the network (`#98 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/98>`_).

* Focus weights can now be specified for particular countries for the network clustering, which allows to set a proportion of the total number of clusters for particular countries (`#87 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/87>`_).

* A new rule :mod:`add_extra_components` allows to add additional components to the network only after clustering. It is thereby possible to model storage units (e.g. battery and hydrogen) in more detail via a combination of ``Store``, ``Link`` and ``Bus`` elements (`#97 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/97>`_).

* Hydrogen pipelines (including cost assumptions) can now be added alongside clustered network connections in the rule :mod:`add_extra_components` . Set ``electricity: extendable_carriers: Link: [H2 pipeline]`` and ensure hydrogen storage is modelled as a ``Store``. This is a first simplified stage (`#108 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/108>`_).

* Logfiles for all rules of the ``snakemake`` workflow are now written in the folder ``log/`` (`#102 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/102>`_).

* The new function ``_helpers.mock_snakemake`` creates a ``snakemake`` object which mimics the actual ``snakemake`` object produced by workflow by parsing the ``Snakefile`` and setting all paths for inputs, outputs, and logs. This allows running all scripts within a (I)python terminal (or just by calling ``python <script-name>``) and thereby facilitates developing and debugging scripts significantly (`#107 <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur/pull/107>`_).
